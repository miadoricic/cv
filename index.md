## Hobbies

- **Music:** In my free time I like to make covers of songs that I produce myself. From 2008 – 2016 I've been an active member of a professional singing ensamble *Putokazi*, where I learned a lot about team work and organization, and also went on to peform in several cities of China and throughout the whole of Croatia.
- **Game character design:** In my spare time I design video game characters and make several stories that could potentially grow to be a plot for a video game.
